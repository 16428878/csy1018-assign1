## Web Development Assignment-1

### Supporting Documentation

#### The supporting documentation, will show the progression of the web development project, from the beginning all the way to the complete website with all pages fully working, therefore all the milestones taken along the way will be discussed in detail and with evidence to show the path that has been taken when creating the site.

#### There was several different stages that was taken during this project, the first one being research; to help understand the project better, then sketches; to get preliminary designs together, then wireframes, to get gauge a more finished plan, to prototypes; to see sample of finished products to make final judgements, and finally progression of work to create the final project, therefore below each section will be discussed in detail to show you how the project developed.

### Research Stage

#### The first section that will be discussed is research; which is essential as this allowed for the correct knowledge to be picked up before starting to create the site, as similar cv website, were looked at to gain a sense of direction in terms of design and content, allowing for a better understanding of the project.

#### There was several different website that were looked at to understand what is being looked for in terms of design when it comes to creating a cv website, therefore due to the project wanting to be fit for purpose several modern clean UI websites where viewed, these include:

- <http://thalida.com/>
- <http://jessdesigntan.com/>
- <http://www.albinotonnina.com/>

#### After analysis, the websites allowed for better understanding of how modern cv website should look and therefore there was several key points that were taken away from the research that will be vital to making sure the projects site is successful, these include:

#### One key design feature that can be taken away is the use of colours, as all sites used colours modestly in terms of the number of different colours used, as all websites used one primary colour and a secondary accent colour, this allowed for the website to stand out and pop, but at the same time still look professional and allowing the content to take center stage.

#### The second key design feature that can be taken away from the examples was the use of responsive pages, that have set breakpoints for mobile and desktop to allow the website to best suite the platform that is on so the user can experience the website in the best possible manner.

#### The final design feature that can be taken away from the research of the examples was the use of High Quality images to break up text used on the website to make users stay attentive when viewing the site, making for a more user engaging experience.

#### In conclusion cv content, design features that are relevant to modern design are the main points that were uncovered in the research stage of the project.

### Sketches

#### Moving onto the sketch section of the project, sketches will be created to get preliminary designs together, this allows for a rough concept to be created to give the project a direction of how the pages should be styled in the most simplest form, therefore below all sketches for different platform will be evidenced.

### Desktop Sketches

#### Below all the desktop sketches have been evidenced, these have been created to outline the preliminary design of all the desktop pages structures and designs.

### Desktop Home

#### Below is the desktop home page, with the basic structure that is needed for the page, this includes no margins for the components that span all the way across, this gives the page a more modern clean look, also navigation bar is beneath the header of the page and followed by a large image and text, below that is 2 sets of sub headers and navigation buttons that are evenly margined and this is capped off with the footer that has no margin and includes several different links.

#### Good Points: The reason for choosing this particular design is due to the large image giving a focal point to the page that will attract the user, above this a navigation bar that spans the whole site to offer easy accessibility and navigation through out the site.

### Desktop CV

#### Below is the desktop CV page, with the basic structure that is needed for the page, this includes no margins for the components that span all the way across, this gives the page a more modern clean look, also navigation bar is beneath the header of the page and followed by a large image and text, below that is 6 sets of sub headers and list style information heavy content that are evenly margined and this is capped off with the footer that has no margin and includes several different links.

#### Good Points: The reason for choosing this particular design is due to the use of sub headers and unordered list, that give the cv page more structure due to it holding so much text content the list format allows for it to be easily understood and followed by the user.

![](readme-media/desktop-cv.jpg)

### Desktop Bio

#### Below is the desktop Bio page, with the basic structure that is needed for the page, this includes no margins for the components that span all the way across, this gives the page a more modern clean look, also navigation bar is beneath the header of the page and followed by a large image and text, below that is 1 set of sub headers and list style information heavy content that are evenly margined, below is 2 sets of 4 navigation buttons and this is capped off with the footer that has no margin and includes several different links.

#### Good Points: The reason for choosing this particular design is due to the use of article style box of information this allows for content to shown individually, whilst being besides each other allowing for content to be structured in a way where more content is available on the viewers initial view range.

![](readme-media/desktop-bio.jpg)

### Desktop Contact

#### Below is the desktop Contact page, with the basic structure that is needed for the page, this includes no margins for the components that span all the way across, this gives the page a more modern clean look, also navigation bar is beneath the header of the page and followed by a large image and text, below that is 1 set of sub headers and list style information heavy content and 1 form that are evenly margined and this is capped off with the footer that has no margin and includes several different links.

#### Good Points: The reason for choosing this particular design is due to the use the range of different options available in the form that has been designed, as the form uses different techniques such as text field, text areas and radio buttons to achieve a comprehensive form.

![](readme-media/desktop-contact.jpg)

### Desktop Portfolio

#### Below is the desktop Portfolio page, with the basic structure that is needed for the page, this includes no margins for the components that span all the way across, this gives the page a more modern clean look, also navigation bar is beneath the header of the page and followed by a large image and text, below that is 1 set of sub headers and list style for downloadable content and 1 video that are evenly margined and this is capped off with the footer that has no margin and includes several different links.

#### Good Points: The reason for choosing this particular design is due to the use the of a video that has the ability to change resolution to whatever display size but also has built in video controls to allow the user to control video and volume operations.

### Wireframes

#### Moving onto the wireframes section of the project, these will be created to get a more detailed design together and therefore will give us in a digitally space a more rigid and structured version of plans to allow for a more accurate diagram of how the final pages will look, therefore below all the wireframes for different platforms will be evidenced.

### Desktop Wireframes

#### Below all the desktop wireframes have been evidenced, these have been created to show a more detailed plan of the webpages in terms of content, design and structure.

### Desktop Home

#### Below is the desktop home page wireframe, starting from the top you have the header of the webpage centered, below you have the navigation bar aligned to the left, below that the main image that spans side to side with a welcome message below, following that is a centered sub header with 4 images with text set on 1 row, followed by another sub header that is centered, which has 4 navigation boxes with links spanning a single row, this is then capped of with a footer that includes a header and links to internal and external pages.

#### Good Points: One good point of this page is that a welcome message is included this allows for the user to be first greeted when entering the landing page, engaging with the users and making them want to explore on further.

![](readme-media/wireframe-desktop-home.png)

### Prototypes

#### Below a very simple prototype was created just for the home page, to gauge an idea of how the final product will look before properly starting to create the web project, this would give the project the final nudge before starting to see if the designs created are suitable and how they look on a finished product.

#### Below you will see the prototype created for the home page, this includes the colour scheme which includes blue's and neutral tones and in terms of font open sans and san serif are being used to see if the design aspects will fit together and look right, in this case the styles work together and therefore is go ahead.

### Models Of Good Practice

#### There are several models of good practice that can be implemented when creating a website, these can help to make the users end experience better and make the website more user friendly to the end users, making the web projects stand out compared to other, these include:

#### One model of good practice that's being used is speed optimization in order to do this all part of the website will be optimize including images and media, will be reduced in size to the lowest sizes possible without disrupting the quality of the media to make sure the webpages can load in the fastest time possible.

![](readme-media/img-optimize.png)

#### Another model of good practice that is being used is clear and several paths of navigation, this include navigation bars, buttons and footer navigation, all of these aspects equal good use of navigation, as by making it easier to find forms of navigation it makes it easier for user to navigate them selves around the site more quicker, making the user experience better, and appealing to users more.

![](readme-media/img-navigation.jpg)

#### Another model of good practice that is being used is in the site being developed is the use of material design, which has been researched on googles material design website, showing how to use flat objects and how to style a website in that fashion, allowing for a clean looking modern website that looks visually appealing.

#### The fifth model of good practice being used is the use of white space, as using blank white space to your advantage can leave a webpage feeling modern and easier to consume for the end user, making it more appealing for users to explore.

#### The final model of good practice is to provide the users with help and instructions, this includes place holder in forms, telling the users what exactly needs to be inputted where and link buttons to get users to certain section s can be seen to aid the users and make their experience of the site better for it as it will allow for a smoother user experience.

### Image editing and optimization

#### In terms of image optimization and editing all images on the website where editing using several different programs including adobe photoshop when available but at most part an online editor called pixlr was used to reduce the size of the images to a more compressed size that would allow for the page to load faster but not destroy the quality of the image at the same time, below an example can be seen of the editor in use.

![](readme-media/img-editor.png)

### Progression of Site
